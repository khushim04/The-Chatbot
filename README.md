I have made this chatbot using Front-end Development.
The chatbot is designed to simulate conversation and provide users with instant responses to their queries.
It features a clean and user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily input their questions and receive answers in real-time. 
The project showcases fundamental web development skills,event handling, and responsive design.
Users can explore the code to understand how the chatbot processes user input and generates appropriate replies.
